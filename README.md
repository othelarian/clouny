# Clouny

Yeah, you guess right (or at least I hope you did), the name is based on a famous coffee drinker. Georgie, if you read this, you're the best.

## What's Clouny is all about?

It's another attempt to create a [quine app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)), like [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com), but closer to [FeatherWiki](https://feather.wiki/), I mean very lightweight (Clouny-base.html is currently < to 1ko), and using nanochoo. It's so close to FeatherWiki that some part of the code are very similar. FeatherWiki, I own you one pal.

## !! STILL IN PROGRESS !!

What's the idea right now:

- having a basic ui to make the base version truly working
- adding a textarea to be able to handle a slug
- working on the server
- using nanochoo to handle the ui

## Plan for the future

Multiple editions:

- One using github.io to present Clouny (because it's cool)
- Always inspired by FeatherWiki, a `serve` command which can backup the the Clouny app
- An nw.js app + dedicated edition, like the TiddlyWiki one, because it's awesome
- A wiki on github for documentation, maybe?

## Current usage

So right now it's barely working. What I already done:

- the generator function, working both on node and browser, so usable both side
- the build and the clean scripts
- the html base

Still a long way to go, but I've hope.
